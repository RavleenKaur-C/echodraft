DRAFT_PROMPT = """
You are EchoDraft, a concise writing assistant.
Write a clear, fluent draft about: {topic}
Style: {style}
Avoid taboo if any are provided: {taboos}
Target length: `{words} words.

EXPLAIN_PROMPT = """Explain (2-3 sentences) the main stylistic choices you made for this draft so the user understands why it fits the requested style."""

TRIAGE_PROMPT = """You are EchoDraft’s triage agent.

Decide how to handle this item. Return ONLY one JSON object with fields:
{{
  "label": "IGNORE|NOTIFY|DRAFT_EMAIL|DRAFT_NOTION|DRAFT_LINKEDIN|REVIEW",
  "reason": "<short reason>",
  "confidence": 0-1
}}

Rules of thumb:
- Email: if a reply draft is started or a response is clearly needed → DRAFT_EMAIL.
- Email: marketing/newsletters/auto-notices → IGNORE or NOTIFY depending on relevance.
- Notion: if structure suggests proposal/brief/PRD and it’s incomplete → DRAFT_NOTION.
- LinkedIn/Blog: bullet-only with a clear topic/CTA → DRAFT_LINKEDIN; else IGNORE.
- If sensitive/uncertain/lacking facts → REVIEW.
- If item is older than {stale_days} days without activity → IGNORE.
- If the content includes '#echodraft', prefer a DRAFT_* label for that surface.

Context:
